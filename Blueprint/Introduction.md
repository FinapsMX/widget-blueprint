Mendix Pluggable Widgets are components that extend the functionality of a Mendix application by allowing developers to create custom user interface elements or integrate external functionality into their Mendix apps.

The concept of pluggable widgets can be broken down into a few core ideals:
1. **Customization**: Pluggable web widgets provide developers with the ability to create custom user interface components or widgets that are not available out-of-the-box in the Mendix platform. This allows for more tailoured and unique user experiences.
2. **Pluggable**: The term "pluggable" implies that these widgets can be easily integrated into your Mendix application. They can be added to app pages using Mendix's visual development environment, allowing developers to drag and drop them onto the page.
3. **Extensibility**: Pluggable web widgets are used to extend the capabilities of Mendix applications beyond what can be achieved using the standard Mendix widgets and features. They can be created using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
4. **Reusable**: Once a pluggable web widget is created, it can be reused in all Mendix apps, making it a powerful tool for developers who want to build a library of custom UI components or integrate specific functionality into their applications.

# Development
This blueprint aims to provide a standardized way of working for the development of widgets. Further information can be found in [Development](https://github.com/FinapsMX/widget-blueprint/blob/main/Blueprint/Development.md).
