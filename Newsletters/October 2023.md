Welcome to the first Widget Development Group's newsletter from October 2023!

## Blueprint refinement
Since drawing up the initial blueprint in the previous month, it has been refined and iterated upon resulting in an easy to follow and concise guide for new widget devs.

## Accessibility
During a Mendix Internal Meetup in which the Huurcommissie's team demonstrated the (lack of) accessibility options within Mendix it became clear that there is a significant gap in the widget offerings for accessibility functionalities. Some examples include:
 - Alternative text containers.
 - Video player with captions.
 - Screen reader-friendly form input.
 - TTS widget.

## Next month
Now that a number of good potential use cases have been identified the blueprint will be employed in order to build a 'real world' widget for the Finaps community.
