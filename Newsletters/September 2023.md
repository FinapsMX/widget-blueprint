ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the first Widget Development Cult's newsletter from September 2023! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Initial blueprint
An initial version of the blueprint was drafted by Sam, reviewed by Luna and put to the test by Max. The aim of the blueprint is to provide a guide for new widget developers to start building and extending the Mendix toolbox.
After working through the blueprint, Max identified a number of areas of improvement which will be adjusted. This iterative review process will be repeated a number of times, hopefully resulting in a thorough and complete blueprint.

## Development
Developing widgets for use in projects help to expand and reinforce skills. A number of widgets have been worked on this month:
 - The CKEditor 5 widget built for use in Rabobank projects has received a number of updates and improvements this month, with a real time word count feature being implemented.
 - For the Rabobank LC&E project, a new large number text field widget was created. This allows users to enter in large numbers in a format which they're used to. Eg. typing 20m will result in 20,000,000 being filled in.
 - A new 'action button' widget is in progress, which will allow for buttons to be created and configured in Mendix where complex conditional visibility is required.

## Next month
The rising prominence of the Widget Development group's has not gone unnoticed, and a number of requests have been made to create new functionality. These are being considered for future development.
